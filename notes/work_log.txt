November 29, 2020 (zach):
- created function to resize images, turn them to grayscale, and save in numpy array
- added a requirmements.txt file

- next steps:
	1. figure out how to incorporate labels with CNN
	2. normalize array data (probably just by dividng each value by 255)
	
December 1, 2020 (angelo):
-merged zach branch
-added command line argument --user for specifying who is using the script. If --user is "zach" the data are taken from the directory Zach has on his machine.
If --user is "angelo" the data are taken from the directory Angelo has on his machine

- next steps:
	1. figure out how to incorporate labels with CNN  => check https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/image/ , basically we need to define the folder structure, tell me when you read this, I can explain what I mean (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
	2. normalize array data (probably just by dividng each value by 255) => Yes you are right and I believe there is a function in Keras that does just that.
