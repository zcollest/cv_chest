November 29, 2020 (zach):
- created function to resize images, turn them to grayscale, and save in numpy array
- added a requirmements.txt file

- next steps:
	1. figure out how to incorporate labels with CNN
	2. normalize array data (probably just by dividng each value by 255)
	
December 1, 2020 (angelo):
-merged zach branch
-added command line argument --user for specifying who is using the script. If --user is "zach" the data are taken from the directory Zach has on his machine.
If --user is "angelo" the data are taken from the directory Angelo has on his machine

- next steps:
	1. figure out how to incorporate labels with CNN  => check https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/image/ , basically we need to define the folder structure, tell me when you read this, I can explain what I mean (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
	2. normalize array data (probably just by dividng each value by 255) => Yes you are right and I believe there is a function in Keras that does just that.

WHAT WE DID
- Decided to use all NIH data, rather than just 5% subsample
- Going to use 500 samples as a downsampling threshold
- Eliminating "Hernia" and "Pneumonia" samples from model (110, 322 respective samples)

WHAT WE NEED TO DO
- Figure out downsampling technique (random sampling, k-means, etc.)
- Download image data ^^

December 13, 2020:
WHAT ANGELO DID:
- set up vs code (non è molto ma è un lavoro onesto)

WHAT WE NEED TO DO
- Figure out downsampling technique (random sampling, k-means, etc.)
- Download image data ^^

December 15, 2020:
WHAT ANGELO DID:
- switched back to random sample dataset because full dataset is to big to handle, might be usefull in the future though
- Implemented the undersampling method "ClusteredCentroids KNN"

WHAT WE NEED TO DO
- normalize data of the 1-d representations of the images
- explore other downsampling technique (random sampling) [MAYBE]
- Compare dataset before and after downsampling

December 19, 2020:
WHAT WE DID:
- check the output of the downsampling function
- normalize data of the 1-d representations of the images
- grayscale images

WHAT WE NEED TO DO:
- plot PCA plots for non undersampled dataset and for undersampled dataset and compare them.
- explore other downsampling technique (random sampling) [MAYBE]

December 27, 2020:
PLAN FOR THE FUTURE:
- Balancing the classes:
	a) upsampling - ZACH
	b) mix of up and down sampling - ANGELO
- Quality assessment:
	a) PCA, t-SNE
- Modeling:
	a) Convolutional neural network
